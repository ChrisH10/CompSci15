	<P4 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size:15px">Favorite Hobby:</P3>
		<p4 style="font-family:Courier;font-size:14px"> 
				<ul>
					<li>My favorite Hobby is using the Computer. I usually tinker with my Computer to either install new hardware or play games. My favorite game is Battlefield. The first piece of hardware I instealled was memory sticks. Last year, I took apart my computer and put it back together in about a day. I really enjoy discovering problems and try fixing them. I got my first computer when I was in 4th grade. I really enjoyed spending time learning about the Operating System (Windows 98) and how it worked. </li>
